[Verse 1]
       D           A             D
I's in love with a girl on marijuana
            D       G      D/F#      A
She said if I'm not stoned I don't wanna
        G          D
But she got so paranoid
    D              G
Her place I would avoid
       G           A            (D)
I's in love with a girl on marijuana

[Verse 2]
        D          A          D
I's in love with a girl on cocaine
        D           G    D        A
She had everything going but her brain
           G                  D
We'd talk endlessly for hours
          D                 G
But by morning it'd go sour
        G          A         (D)
I's in love with a girl on cocaine

[Break]
(D) D  D  D

[Chorus]
        G               D/F#
Through extacy, crystal meth and glue
  A                D
I found no drug compares to you
G                D/F#
All these pills, all this weed
A
I don't know just what I need

[Break]
A  A  A  A

[Verse 3]
        D           A          D
I's in love with a girl on L.S.D.
D          G                A
She'd see things I'd never see
     G                 D
She broadened her perspective
     D              G
Then I got more selective
        G          A          (D)
I's in love with a girl on L.S.D.

[Break]
(D) D  D  D

[Chorus]
        G               D/F#
Through extacy, crystal meth and glue
  A                D
I found no drug compares to you
G                D/F#
All these pills, all this weed
A
I don't know just what I need

[Break]
A  A  A

[Verse 4]
        D           A               D
I's in love with a girl who drank beer
     D               G             A
'Til bad breath and all she disappeared
         G                D
She was blowing up real bad
         D                    G
But when she left I was still sad
        G           A             (D)
I's in love with a girl who drank beer

[Verse 5]
        D           A              D
I's in love with a girl on china white
         D             G        A
we were married for a year one night
     G             D
her memory still lingers
       D              G
cause I burned all my fingers
        G           A            (D)
I's in love with a girl on china white

[Break]
(D) D  D  D

[Verse 6]
        D           A               D
I's in love with a girl who drank coffee
           D            G                 A
There was times when I couldn't keep her off me
      G                D
That caffeine got her going
         D             G
But her ugly side was showing
        G           A            (D)
I's in love with a girl who drank coffee

[Break]
(D) D  D  D

[Verse 7]
        D           A              D
I's in love with a girl who was a dealer
      D        G      D/F#     A
I's afraid somebody'd come and steal her
    G              D
We never used to fight
          D                  G
But the phone rang day and night
         D         A             (D)
I's in love with a girl who was a dealer

[Outro]
(D) D  D  D

D                                             D
  Sure as hell she got popped by the big guys



Note: When you're strumming the D chord do the following slide every now
and then before each verse: xxx23x ----- xxx77X ----- xxx23x (it's hard to
explain in writing, but if you hear the song you'll know what bit I'm
talking about)
