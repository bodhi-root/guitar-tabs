Smelly Cat Smelly Cat What are they feeding you
Smelly Cat Smelly Cat It's not your fault

E                   A
They won't take you to the vet
       D         A        E  
You're obviously not their favorite pet
E                       A
You may not be a bed of roses
           D  A                    E  
And you're no friend to those with noses

  E                 A
I found you in my bed
 D                    A
How'd you wind up there?
     E          A
You are a mystery

Little Black Curly Hair.


'Your Love'

Am
Love is sweet as summer showers
Am
Love is a wondrous work of art
    Am
But your love, oh your love, your love
Am                F
Is a giant pigeon
Am
Crapping on my heart
Am
La, la, la, la, la, la . . .
