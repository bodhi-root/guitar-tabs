MAIN RIFF

<VERSE>
Load up on guns and - Bring your friends
It's fun to lose - And to pretend
She's over bored - And self assured
Oh no, I know - A dirty word

<CHORUS>

   Hello, Hello, Hello, how low?  (x4)

     With the lights out it's less dangerous
     Here we are now - Entertain us
     I feel stupid and contagious
     Here we are now - Entertain us
     A mulatto - An albino
     A mosquito - My Libido...  Yeah!

     BRIDGE

<VERSE>
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

CHORUS

<VERSE>
And I forget - Just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard - It was hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

CHORUS (followed by: )
Yeah, a denial
A denial
A denial...
