INTRO x2

<VERSE x4>
It's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
...Since I first saw you
...Since I could stand on my own two feet again
...Since I could call you

<CHORUS x4>
But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

<VERSE x4>
It's been awhile
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted
...Since I could say I love myself as well
...Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
...But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

<CHORUS x4>
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

<BRIDGE>
Why must I feel this way
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

<VERSE x4>
It's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
...Since I said I'm sorry
...Since I've seen the way the candle lights your face
...But I can still remember just the way you taste

<CHORUS>
But everything I can't remember as
Fucked up as it all may seem to be - I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

<VERSE>
It's been a while since I could hold my head up high
And it's been a while since I said I'm sorry...
