<INTRO>
There's no money - There's no possessions
Only obsession - I don't need that shit
Take my money - Take my obsession. . .

<CHORUS 1 - CHORUS 2>

<VERSE>
(I just want to be heard) Loud and clear are my words
Coming from within man tell them what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind - Till you find a conclusion
Lost out in obsession
Diamond rings get you nothing but a life long lesson
And your pocketbooks stressing
You're a slave to the system working jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinking about yourself start thinking about

(CHORUS) <CHORUS 3>
There's no money - There's no possession
Only obsession - I don't need that shit
Take my money - Take my possession
Take my obsession - I don't need that shit

<VERSE>
(Because everything is nothing) And emptiness isn't everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out it's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possession though you're never gonna feel the void
Take it away and learn your best lesson
The heart the soul the life the passion

CHORUS

<BREAKDOWN>
Money! possession! obsession!

<INTRO>
Present yourself - Press your clothes  
Comb your hair - And clock in
You just can't win - Just can't win
And the things you own - Own you
Nooooooooooooo


<CHORUS 3>
Take my money - Take my possession -
Take my obsession - I don't need that shit!
Fuck your money - Fuck your possession -
Fuck your obsession - I don't need that shit!

<CHORUS 4>
Money! Possession! Obsession! I don't need that shit!
