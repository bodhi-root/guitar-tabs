```
D
Nibblin' on some sponge cake
D
Watching the sun bake
D                                  A
All of those tourists covered with oil
A
Strumming my six-string
A
On my front porch swing
A7                                       D    D7
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil


CHORUS:
G         A                  D            D7  
  Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
G                 A               D     D7
  Searching for my lost shaker of salt
G              A                   D  A     G
  Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
        A7                  D
  But I know  it's nobody's fault


I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop-top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claimt hat ther's a woman to blame
But I know it's my own damned fault

Yes, and some people claim that ther's a woman to balme
And I know, it's my own damned fault
