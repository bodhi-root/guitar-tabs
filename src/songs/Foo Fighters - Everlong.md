If you can't hit the Gsus2, a regular G sounds almost as good.


## Strumming

Dmaj7 gets 1 whole bar. So does Bsus2.  Gsus2 and Bsus2 split a bar. Then you stay on Bsus2 for the last bar.

```
| Dmaj7~~~  | Bsus2~~~  | Gsus2 Bsus2 | Bsus2~~~ |
```

Dave strums the lower notes of the chord a few times and then the higher notes of the chord.

[Verse]
Dmaj7
Hello
     Bsus2
I've waited here for you
Gsus2 Bsus2
Everlong
Dmaj7
Tonight
  Bsus2
I throw myself into
Gsus2             Bsus2
And out of the red, out of her head she sang
Dmaj7
Come down
    Bsus2
And waste away with me
Gsus2    Bsus2
Down with me
Dmaj7
Slow how
    Bsus2
You wanted it to be
Gsus2           Bsus2
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
D A

     D
And I wonder
A               D
When I sing along with you

[Chorus]
B5                    G5                  D5
If everything could ever feel this real forever
B5                  G5                D5
If anything could ever be this good again
B5                    G5                  D5
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
                          A5               G5
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Instrumental]
Dmaj7 Bsus2 Gsus2   Bsus2

[Verse]
Dmaj7
Breathe out
   Bsus2
So I could breathe you in
Gsus2    Bsus2
Hold you in
Dmaj7
And now
  Bsus2
I know you've always been
Gsus2             Bsus2
Out of your head, out of my head I sang

[Pre-Chorus]
D A

     D
And I wonder
A               D
When I sing along with you

[Chorus]
B5                    G5                  D5
If everything could ever feel this real forever
B5                  G5                D5
If anything could ever be this good again
B5                    G5                  D5
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
                          A5               G5
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

And I wonder
B5                    G5                  D5
If everything could ever feel this real forever
