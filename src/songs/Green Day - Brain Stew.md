[Intro]

A   G   F#m   F E x2


[Verse 1]
A                G                  F#m   F E
  I'm having trouble trying to sleep
A               G                   F#m   F E
  I'm counting sheep but running out
A               G
  As time ticks by
  F#m         F E
And still I try
A                G            F#m
  No rest for crosstops in my mind
F             E
On my own ... here we go

A   G   F#m   F E x2


[Verse 2]
A                   G                      F#m   F E
  My eyes feel like they're going to bleed
A                G            F#m   F E
  Dried up and bulging out my skull
A               G
  My mouth is dry
F#m          F    E
  My face is numb
A                G             F#m
  Fucked up and spun out in my room
F             E
On my own ... here we go

A   G   F#m   F E x2


[Verse 3]
A               G           F#m   F E
  My mind is set on overdrive
A               G             F#m   F E
  The clock is laughing in my face
A              G
  Crooked spine
F#m      F      E
  Senses dulled
A                  G         F#m
  Passed the point of delirium
F             E
On my own ... here we go

A   G   F#m   F E x2


[Verse 4]
A                   G                      F#m   F E
  My eyes feel like they're going to bleed
A                G            F#m   F E
  Dried up and bulging out my skull
A               G
  My mouth is dry
F#m          F    E
  My face is numb
A                G             F#m
  Fucked up and spun out in my room
F             E
On my own ... here we go

A   G   F#m   F E x6, A
