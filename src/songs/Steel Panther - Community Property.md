Capo 1st Fret

```
[Verse]
         D
I would give you the stars in the sky
                       A
But they're too far away
    D
If you were a hooker, you'd know
                  A
I'd be happy to pay
 D
If suddenly you were a guy
                  A
I'd be suddenly gay

[Chorus]
           D        G       A
'Cause my heart belongs to you
    D       G        A
My love is pure and true
    D        G       A
My heart belongs to you
    G
But my cock is community property

[Verse]
            D
You're the only girl that I like to screw
                     A
When I'm not on the road
 D
When I come home, my dinner's made
                       A
And the front lawn is mowed
 D
I'll kiss your mouth
                           A
Even after you swallow my load

[Chorus]
           D        G       A
'Cause my heart belongs to you
             D           G          A
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do, for you
    D        G       A
My heart belongs to you
    G                                G D A(listen to the song to get this thing right)
But my cock is community property

[Bridge]
A       Bm       G
I wanna make it clear
So you retain it
A       Bm        G
My dick's a free spirit
And you can't restrain it
No, you just can't chain it down

[Solo]
[A Bm G G x3]

[Verse](picked)
 D
I love you so much it hurts
                    A
From my head to my feet
 D
I think of you and I can't
                    A
Help but fondle my meat
 D
I see your face every time
                    A
That I go out and cheat

[Chorus]
           D        G       A
'Cause my heart belongs to you
             D           G          A
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
    D        G       A
My heart belongs to you
        D         G        A
But my dong is community property

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
D G A A x4
