La la la-la-la, La la la-la-la

CHORUS x2 with MAIN FILL
VERSE 1 x2 bass only - <FILL 1>

<VERSE 1 - x4 bass, x4 with guitar>
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over - I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert  <FILL 2>
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay cause I've got no self-esteem

CHORUS
Oh yeah, yeah yeah-yeah       Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah-yeah       Oh yeah, yeah

<VERSE 1 - x2 bass, x2 guitar & bass>
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

CHORUS

<VERSE 2 ending with MAIN FILL>
When she's saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right?

<VERSE 1 - x2 bass> FILL 1

<VERSE 1 - x4 bass, x4 with guitar>
Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score  <FILL 2>
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb - But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

CHORUS

REPEAT VERSE 2
