INTRO

<VERSE>
I've dreamed about this, Sixteen days away
Now you're here, and my head lays
Besides your body, pillowed under mine
You were poison, spinning 'round my mind

CHORUS:
Welcome to my world, she said,
Do you feel alive, she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world, she said,
Separated world, she said
Separated

SOLO

<POST CHORUS>
Down poison (You weren't there for me, I was there for you) x4
Down poison (You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you) x3
Down poison (You wouldn't die, You wouldn't die, You wouldn't die)

CHORUS

<POST CHORUS>
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down poison
Down. . .
