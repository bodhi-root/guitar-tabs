INTRO

<VERSE>
I've dreamed about this, Sixteen days away
Now you're here, and my head lays
Besides your body, pillowed under mine
You were poison, spinning 'round my mind

CHORUS:
Welcome to my world, she said,
Do you feel alive, she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world, she said,
Separated world, she said
Separated

<POST CHORUS>
Down poison
Down poison

<VERSE>
Body withered, body died,
Time to take away this life
Bad enough to die from one,
Not to mention four or five

CHORUS

<POST CHORUS>
Down poison x 4

SOLO

<POST CHORUS>
Down poison (You weren't there for me, I was there for you) x4
Down poison (You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you) x3
Down poison (You wouldn't die, You wouldn't die, You wouldn't die)

CHORUS

<POST CHORUS>
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down poison
Down. . .


OUTRO (some palm-muted E power chords)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[This song is a mix with a clean guitar playing barred chords while
  a distorted guitar plays the corresponding power chords.  The INTRO
  consists of the verse played twice by the distorted guitar and then
  twice by the clean one.  The CHORUS has the same feel as the verse but
  played about twice as fast.  Also, the first VERSE is played by the
  clean guitar alone while the distorted one joins and then takes over
  the second one.  The SOLO is only someone's approximation]
