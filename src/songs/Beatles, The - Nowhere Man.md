C           G
He's a real nowhere man
F              C
Sitting in his nowhere land
F              Fm                F   C    Bb  F  C
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

C              G
Doesn't have a point of view
F                    G
Knows not where he's going to
F          Fm               F   C
Isn't he a bit like you and me?


CHORUS:
         Em         F
Nowhere man, please listen
          Em               F
You don't know what you're missing
        Em       F                    G7
Nowhere man, the world is at your command


He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

<CHORUS>
Nowhere man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Leave it all 'till somebody else lends you a hand

He's a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
F              Fm                F   C
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
F              Fm                C
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody...
