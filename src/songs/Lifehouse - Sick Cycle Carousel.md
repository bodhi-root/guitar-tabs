<VERSE>
If shame had a face I think it would kind of look like mine
If it had a home would it be my eyes?
Would you believe me if I said I'm tired of this?
Well here we go, now, one more time...

<BRIDGE>
Am                Em         F                  G         Am
'Cause I tried to climb your steps - I tried to chase you down
           Em      F                    G
I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground
Am             Em      F                G         Am
And I tried to earn my way - I tried to tame this mind
       Em              F           G        
You better believe that I have tried to be this

<CHORUS>
C                G                      Am
   When will this end? - It goes on and on
         F               C
Over and over and over again
                 G                           Am
Keeps spinning around - I know that it won't stop
             F                 C
'Til I stand down from this for good

VERSE

<VERSE>
I never thought I'd end up here
Never thought I'd be standing where I am
I guess I kind of thought that it would be easier than this
I guess I was wrong, now, one more time...


<BRIDGE>
'Cause I tried to climb your steps - I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground
And I tried to earn my way - I tried to tame this mind

<CHORUS>
When will this end? - It goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keeps spinning around - I know that it won't stop
'Til I stand down from this sick cycle carousel

<BRIDGE>  
This is a sick cycle carousel, yeah
Sick cycle carousel
This is a sick cycle carousel, yeah

VERSE

<CHORUS>
When will this end?
It goes on and on
Over and over and then over again
Keeps spinning around
I know that it won't stop
'Til I stand down from this for good
