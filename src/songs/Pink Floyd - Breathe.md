CHORUS

    Cmaj7
For long you live and high you fly

    Bm7
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

Fmaj7
All you touch and all you see

   G                  D7#9 B7b9
Is all your life will ever be.

Em7           A    A7sus4 A7
  Run, rabbit run.

Em                         A   A7sus4 A
Dig that hole, forget the sun,

Em7                        A    A7sus4 A7
  When at last the work is done

Em7                                  A      Asus4 A
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

CHORUS:

    Cmaj7
For long you live and high you fly

    Bm7
But only if you ride the tide

    Fmaj7
And balanced on the biggest wave

    G                D7#9         D7b9     Em
You race towards an early grave.
