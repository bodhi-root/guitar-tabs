[Verse 1]

  D                          Bb/D
  High above the mucky-muck, castle made of clouds
  D                         Bb/D
      There sits Wonderboy, sitting oh so proudly
  D5                 D/C#                           Bm          Asus4  G  A
      Not much to say    when you're high above the mucky-muck, yeah,    yeah


[Chorus]

  D        Bb/D  D             Bb/D
      Wonderboy,    what is the secret of your power?
  D5        D/C#           Bm          Asus4         G     A    D
      Wonderboy, won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck man?

[Verse 2]

  D                                                 Bb/D
  Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman
                              D                                  Bb/D
  Arch rival and nemesis of Wonderboy, with powers comparable to Wonderboy
       D5                                                 D/C#
  What powers do you ask? I dunno, how about the power of flight?
                           Bm                           Asus4
  That do anything for ya?    That's levitation, Holmes
                                  G                       D/F#
  How 'bout the power to kill a yak from 200 yards away...
       Em            A7        Aadd11/A   A7(v2)   Dadd11/A(v2)
  With mind bullets!    That's teleki   -   nesis, Kyle
  G/A                    A7(v3)
      How 'bout the power,    to move you?

[Verse 3]
D             Bb/D            D
  History of Wonderboy, and Young NastyMan
Bb/D
  Riggah-go-goo, riggah-goo-goo
   D5                 D/C#
A secret to be told, a gold chest to be bold
     Bm                        Asus4     G  A
And blasting forth in three-part harmony


[Chorus]

  D        Bb/D  D             Bb/D
      Wonderboy,    what is the secret of your power?
  D5        D/C#           Bm          Asus4         G     A    D
      Wonderboy, won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck man?

[Verse 4]

        D
  Well, Wonderboy and Young Nastyman joined forces;
  Bb/D                                            D
  They formed a band the likes of which had never been seen,
                              Bb/D
  And they called themselves Tenacious D. That's right,
  D5              D/C#       Bm           Asus4  G   A        C  G  D
  Me! And KG! ("That's me"),    we're now Tena   -   cious D!

  Come fly with me, fly!

[Outro]

  D   Bb/D                D                    Bb/D
  Oh! Take my hand! Young Nasty Man, and we'll fly!
                 D                       Bb/D
  Bring out your broadsword, there's the hydra
            D                    Bb/D
  Slice his throat, and grab his scrote
               D                        Bb/D
  You take the high road, I'll take the low
  D                         Bb/D                   D
  There, the crevasse, fill it, with some mighty juice!
