<VERSE>
To my mother, to my father,
It's your son or it's your daughter,
Are my screams loud enough for you to hear me?
Should I turn this up for you?

<CHORUS>
I sit locked inside my head
Remembering everything you've said
This silence gets us nowhwere!
Gets us nowhere way too fast!

<VERSE>
The silence is what kills me
I need someone here to help me
But you don't know how to listen             BREAKDOWN
And let me make my decisions
                                             D |-------------|
<CHORUS>                                     A |-------------| x6
'Cause I sit here locked inside my head      D |-3-3-3-3-3-3-|
Remembering everything you've said               * * * * * *
The silence gets us nowhere!
Gets us nowhere to fast!                     D |-3-----------|
                                             A |-3-----------| x2
<BREAKDOWN>                                  D |-3-3-3-3-3-3-|
All your insults and your curses make              * * * * *
Me feel like I'm not a person             
And I feel like I am nothing but             D |-3-3---------|
You made me so do something                  A |-3-3---------| x2
'Cause I'm fucked up because you are         D |-3-3-3-3-3-3-|
Need attention, attention you couldn't give
                                             D |-3-1/3-1/3-1/3-1-1-|
<CHORUS> x 2                                 A |-3-1/3-1/3-1/3-1-1-| x4
I sit here locked inside my head             D |-3-1/3-1/3-1/3-1-1-|
Remembering everything you've said
This silence get us nowhere!
Gets us nowhere way to fast
