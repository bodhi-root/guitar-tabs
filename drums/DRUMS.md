### Tunings

Tried to copy Morgan Rose (Sevendust) from tune-bot artists site:

| Drum     | Fundamental | Top Lug | Bottom Lug | Notes                        |
|----------|-------------|---------|------------|------------------------------|
| Snare    | 209 Hz      | 291 Hz  | 400 Hz     | Kept this one as-is          |
| 12" Tom  | 139 Hz      | 220 Hz  | 260 Hz     | Changed to F#3 (major triad) |
| 14" Tom  | 81 Hz       | 153 Hz  | 127 Hz     | Changed to D3 (on 13")       |
| 16" Tom  | 64 Hz       | 118 Hz  | 103 Hz     | Changed to D3                |
| 18" Tom  | 50 Hz       |  82 Hz  |  87 Hz     |                              |
| 22" Kick | 56 Hz       |  92 Hz  |  92 Hz     |                              |

 Returned in the morning to D2, G#2, A#2
 Tuner-bot recommends: 2C#, 2F, 2A

 Ear: 4th then 3 half steps
 D3, G2, A#2

also:
2D#, 2G# (200 bottom) 2B
- that 13" inch drum just doesn't want to go below G#
- 2D# to 2G# is a 4th
- 2G# to 2B is minor 3rd (take 2B to 3C and we'd have another 4th)

## ATV EXS-5

Pads:

* Snare: 13"
* Floor Tom: 13"
* Rack Toms (x2): 10"
* Kick: 13"

Cymbals:

* Hi-hat: 14"
* Crash (x2): 14"
* Ride: 16"

NOTE: I was having a hard time with the primary crash.  I'd hit too close to the bell and even hit the hardware occasionally.  So I'd move it back, but then I'd miss completely sometimes.  (Maybe my accuracy needs to improve?)  I swapped it with the ride to give me a 16" crash target.  The ride is now a measly 14", but I don't have problems with that one.  I'm usually looking at it when I play it and it's hit pretty consistently
rather than the crash which gets hit periodically and oftentimes just once.  The 16" ride was actually hanging over my toms anyway so maybe this solves two problems.  I was thinking of upgrading to an 18" ride for $449 but I don't know if I need to now.  If we want to add cymbals this would be a good way to do it.  Put the 18" ride on and use the 14" somewhere else.  Or If I'm good with the 14" just buy more of those since they're about half the price.

### Addictive Drums Config

Addictive Drums does not have ATV models as presets.  Instead, I just used a Roland TD-27.  (Roland TD-50 was messing up my ride cymbal and always triggering the shaft hit.)  You have to click the toggle for "reverse hi hat" or else the closed hat will sound like an open one.  Also straighten out the hi hat level lines so they aren't slanted.  This felt like it did a better job opening and closing.

I also had to tell it to learn the cross-stick hit on the right side of my snare.  It was doing it in some spots but not others.  The right side was triggering a rim shot.  This was relatively easy to correct.
