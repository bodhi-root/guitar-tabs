    <pre><code>Intro: G Cadd9

G                                 Cadd9
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night. Although we
G                               Cadd9
both lie close together we feel miles apart inside. Was it
G                   Cadd9                   G                  Cadd9
something I said or something I did? Did my words not come out right? Though I
D                               C
tried not to hurt you, though I tried. But I guess that&#39;s why they say

(CHORUS)
G                  Cadd9
Ev&#39;ry rose has its thorn, just like
G                   Cadd9
ev&#39;ry night has its dawn. Just like
G     D                C        G
ev&#39;ry cowboy sings his sad, sad song
                   C
Ev&#39;ry rose has its thorn
G Cadd9 G Cadd9

G                                          Cadd9
Listen to our favorite song playing on the radio hear the
G                              Cadd9
D.J. say love&#39;s a game of easy come and easy go. But I
G              Cadd9        G              Cadd9
wonder does he know, has he ever felt like this? And I
D                                 C
know that you&#39;d be right now if I could&#39;ve let you know somehow. I guess

CHORUS
G                  Cadd9
Ev&#39;ry rose has its thorn . . .

Em                   D             C                  G
Though it&#39;s been a while now I can still feel so much pain.
Em                  D                          C
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals, but the scar,
            G      Cadd9 G Cadd9
that scar remains

G                                                    Cadd9
I know I could have saved our love that night if I&#39;d known what to say
G                              Cadd9
Instead of making love we both made our separate ways. Now I
G                     Cadd9        G                       Cadd9
hear you&#39;ve found somebody new and that I never meant that much to you. To
D                                   C
hear that tears me up inside and to see you cuts me like a knife. I guess

CHORUS
G                  Cadd9
Ev&#39;ry rose has its thorn. . .
