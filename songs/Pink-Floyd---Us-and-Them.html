    <pre><code>Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D Dsus2   (x2)

Dsus     Esus2/D  Dm(maj7)
Us, and them
                         G/D            D (A/D) (D) A/D
And after all we&#39;re only ordinary men.
Dsus2   Esus2/D  Dm(maj7)
Me, and you.
                             G/D                    D A/C#
God only knows it&#39;s not what we would choose to do.
Bm
Forward he cried from the rear
              Bm/A  D/G   C
and the front rank died.
    Bm                                   A
The general sat and the lines on the map
D/G                C
moved from side to side.
Dsus2     Esus2/D  Dm(maj7)
Black and blue
                                 G/D         Dsus2
And who knows which is which and who is who.
       Esus2/D  Dm(maj7)
Up and down.
                         G/D                         D A/D A/C#
And in the end it&#39;s only round and round and round.
 Bm
&quot;Haven&#39;t you heard? It&#39;s a battle of words&quot;
Bm/A  D/G         C
the poster bearer cried.
 Bm
&quot;Listen son&quot;, said the man with the gun
 Bm/A    D/G          C
&quot;There&#39;s room for you inside.&quot;

Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D A/D          Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D Dsus2
Bm Bm/A D/G C Bm A Bm Bm/A G C

Dsus2    Esus2/D  Dm(maj7)
Down and out
                                 G/D              D
It can&#39;t be helped but there&#39;s a lot of it about.
Dsus2     Esus2/D  Dm(maj7)
With, without.
                              G/D                   D
And who&#39;ll deny it&#39;s what the fighting&#39;s all about?
Bm
Out of the way, it&#39;s a busy day
Bm/A D/G              C
I&#39;ve got things on my mind.
        Bm
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
Bm/A D/G    C
The old man died.
