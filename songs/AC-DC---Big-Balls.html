VERSE: (words spoken, let chords ring)

         E                      C      
Well I'm upper-upper class high society
      E                     C
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
      E                            C
And I always fill my ballroom - The event is never small
    D                             B  B    B     B  B
The social pages say I've got the biggest balls of all


CHORUS: (chords played sharply)

E  / / / /           C#m  / / / /
I've got big balls - I've got big balls
They're such big balls - And they're dirty big balls
And he's got big balls - And she's got big balls
     C     C   C   D     D A     A  A         B
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)


VERSE:
And my balls are always bouncing - My ballroom always full
And everybody cums and cums again
If your name is on the guest list - No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got great balls of fire

CHORUS

VERSE:
Some balls are held for charity ' And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure they're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing ' To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night.
