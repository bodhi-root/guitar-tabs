[Intro]
Am Em F C

[Verse]
 Am                    Em   F   C
Bury all your secrets in my skin
 Am                        Em  F                   C
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
 Am                         Em       F   C
The air around me still feels like a cage
 Am                           Em   F                       C
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…

[Pre-Chorus]
Am Em F C

[Chorus]
                        G                       Am
So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.
                             G                               Am
My heart is just too dark to care. I can&#39;t destroy what isn&#39;t there.
                    G                            Am
Deliver me into my Fate - If I&#39;m alone I cannot hate
                       G
I don&#39;t deserve to have you…
    F                                                     Am
My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know

[Pre-Verse]
Am Em F C

[Verse]
    Am                   Em      F   C
I still press your letters to my lips
     Am                        Em     F              C
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
   Am                         Em    F    C
I couldn&#39;t face a life without your light
    Am                            Em   F                   C
But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight

[Chorus]
                                G                              Am
So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                          G                                 Am
You couldn&#39;t hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                            G                                   Am
I only wish you weren&#39;t my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                          G
I never claimed to be a Saint…
    F                                                            Am
My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go

[Solo]
Am Em F C

[Chorus]
                              G
So Break Yourself Against My Stones
                         Am
And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
                     G
You Never Needed Any Help
                         Am
You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself
                       G
And I Won&#39;t Listen To Your Shame
                            Am
You Ran Away - You&#39;re All The Same
                   G
Angels Lie To Keep Control…

[Outro]
    F
My Love Was Punished Long Ago
                                     A5 B5 C5 E5 F5
If You Still Care, Don&#39;t Ever Let Me Know
                                        Am Em F C (x2), Am
If you still care, don&#39;t ever let me know…
