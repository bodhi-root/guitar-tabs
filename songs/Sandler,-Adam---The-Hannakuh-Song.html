    <pre><code> Intro: This is a song, that uh, there&#39;s alot of Xmas songs out there,
but not too many about Hanukkah, so I wrote a song for all those nice
little Jewish kids who don&#39;t get to hear any Hanukkah songs--here we go...

[A] Put on your [E] yalmulka, [D] here comes [E] Hanukkah
It&#39;s [A] so much [E] fun-akkah to [D] celebrate [E]Hanukkah,
[A]Hanukkah [E]is the [D] Festival of [E] Lights,
[A] Instead of one day of [E] presents, we have [Bm] eight [D] crazy [E] nights.
[A] When you feel like the only [E] kid in town with[D]out a Xmas [E]tree,
[A] Here&#39;s a list of [E] people who are Jewish, [D] just like you and [E] me:

[A] David Lee [E] Roth [D] lights the me[E]norrah,
[A] So do James [E] Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the [D] late Dinah [E]Shore-ah
[A] Guess who eats to[E]gether at the [D] Karnickey [E] Deli,
[A] Bowzer from [E] Sha-na-na, and [D] Arthur Fonzer[E]relli.

[A] Paul Newman&#39;s half [E] Jewish; [D] Goldie Hawn&#39;s half [E] too,
[A] Put them to[E]gether--what a [D] fine lookin&#39; [E] Jew! [Esus] [E]
[D] You don&#39;t need &#39;Deck the Halls&#39; or &#39;Jingle Bell Rock&#39;
[E] Cause you can spin the dreidl with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock--both Jewish! [Esus]

[A] Put on your [E] yalmulka, it&#39;s [D] time for [E] Hanukkah,
The [A] owner of the Seattle Super[E]sonic-ahs [D] celebrates [E] Hanukkah.
[A] O.J. [E] Simpson--[D] not a [E] Jew!
But [A] guess who [E]is...Hall of [D] Famer--Rod [E]Carew--(he converted!) [Bm]

[A] We got Ann [E] Landers and her [D] sister Dear Ab[E]by,
[A] Harrison Ford&#39;s a [E] quarter Jewish--[D] not too [E] shabby!

[A] Some people [E] think that [D] Ebeneezer [E] Scrooge is,
Well, he&#39;s [A] not, but [E] guess who is: [D] All three [E] stooges. [Esus] [E]
[D] So many Jews are in show biz-- [E] Tom Cruise isn&#39;t, [tacit] but I heard his agent is. [Esus]

[A] Tell your friend Ver[E]onica, it&#39;s [D] time you celebrate [E] Hanukkah I
[A] hope I get a har[E]monica, on this [D] lovely, lovely [E] Hanukkah.
So [A] drink your gin-and-[E]tonic-ah, and [D]smoke your mara[E]juanic-ah,
If you [A] really, really [E]wanna-kah, Have a [D] happy, happy, [E] happy, happy [A] Hanukkah.
