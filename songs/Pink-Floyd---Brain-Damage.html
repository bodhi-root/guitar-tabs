    <pre><code>D                           G7/D
  The lunatic is on the grass.
D                           G7/D
  The lunatic is on the grass.
D                       E/D
  Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.
A7                                 D  Dsus2
Got to keep the loonies on the path.

D                           G7/D
  The lunatic is in the hall.
D                           G7/D
  The lunatics are in my hall.
D                              E/D
  The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
    A7                             D     Dsus2 D7 D9
And every day the paper boy brings more.

G                            A
  And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
    C                                  G
And if there is no room upon the hill
G                                    A7
  And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
C                                          G     Bm7 Em7 A A7
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

D                          G7/D
  The lunatic is in my head. (laughter)
D                          G7/D
  The lunatic is in my head.
D                     E/D
  You raise the blade, you make the change
A7                                D    Dsus2
  You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
D                       E/D
  You lock the door and throw away the key
          A7                              D    Dsus2 D7 D9
  There's someone in my head but it's not me.

G                          A
  And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
C                                   G
  You shout and no one seems to hear.
                                   A           A7        A
  And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
       C                                   G Bm7 Em A7
  I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
