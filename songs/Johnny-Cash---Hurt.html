    <h2>Notes</h2>
<p>To play the chorus correctly and simulate the piano playing, keep the G on the third fret of the
high e string fretted with your pinky. This makes the chords G major, Am7, Fadd9, and C major.
I also suggest playing a Hendrix Fadd9, so wrap your thumb and play 1st fret low E string.</p>
<p>The strum pattern for Intro/Verse/Transition is picked for the downs and strummed for the ups.
I suggest picking the A and D strings, and then up strum.</p>

<h2>Song</h2>
<pre><code>[Intro]
Am    C  D  Am    C  D


[Verse 1]
Am   C       D     Am       C      D       Am
   I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
  C    D        Am        C      D          Am
I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
    C      D       Am         C      D       Am
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
       C      D      Am           C      D      G
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything


[Chorus 1]
Am              F     C               G
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Am          F             C        G
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    Am                 F    G               G
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Am              F      G                Am
I will let you down    I will make you hurt


[Transition]
(Am)   C  D  Am    C  D


[Verse 2]
Am   C         D        Am        C      D       Am
   I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair
C       D        Am       C     D    Am
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
  C          D        Am         C       D       Am
Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear
C         D      Am    C     D           G
You are someone else   I am still right here


[Chorus 2]
Am              F     C               G
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Am          F             C        G
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    Am                 F    G            G
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Am              F     G               G
I will let you down   I will make you hurt


[Outro]
   Am               F     G              G
If I could start again  a million miles away
Am              F    G
I would keep myself  I would find a way
                 (single strum)
