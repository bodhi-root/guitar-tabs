    <pre><code>Psssst
Gonorrhea, oh no, I just had my first dose
Of gonorrhea

She gave me her mind
Then she gave me her body
But it seems to me
That she gave it to anybody
But I made her cry
And I made her scream (scream for me)
I took her high
And I curdled her cream
But how was I to know that she had been there before
She told me she was a virgin
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the clinical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch

She&#39;s got the Jack
(I hate to tell you this darling)

I searched her mind
And then I searched her body
...But so did everybody
But she gave me her heart
And she gave me her soul
And a great, big - worn out
Empty hole
But how was I to know it had been filled in before
She said, &quot;Bon, I&#39;ve never had the urgency&quot;
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the critical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch

She&#39;s got the Jack
(I&#39;ll kill her)
(Oh and it hurts)

You know, I woke up one morning, and there it was on the sheets: the clap
Now I know you all call it the clap over here so what I&#39;m gonna do
I&#39;m gonna say &quot;She&#39;s got the --&quot;, and I want you all to shout out
Just what it is she&#39;s got, in this case it&#39;s the clap
And if you wanna know who gave it to her, don&#39;t look at me

She&#39;s got the ...
(I wanna hear your voices)
She&#39;s got the ... clap
(That guy down there, whatta you doing?)
(Yeah, you show me)
(She got that too, ha?)


(I think what she needs ... is an Angus Young penicillin)
