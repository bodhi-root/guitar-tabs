    <pre><code>C              Em
Day after day, love turns grey
         F                   C
Like the skin of a dying man
C                            Em
And night after night, we pretend it's all right
    Dm
But I have grown older and
Dm
You have grown colder and
Dm                   G7
Nothing is very much fun anymore.
    C     Em   F                      C
And I can feel one of my turns coming on.
C Fmaj7 Em    Dm
I       feel, cold as a razor blade
Dm
Tight as a tourniquet
Dm               G7
Dry as a funeral drum

&lt;BARRE CHORDS, played with sudden energy&gt;
Eb           Bb            Eb              Bb
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
       C7      Dm Bb E7  Dm     Am  Dm    Am
You'll find my favourite axe
Eb              Bb
Don't look so frightened
        Eb                   Bb
This is just a passing phase
       Dm           Bb
One of my bad days
          Eb              Bb
Would you like to watch T.V.?
   Eb                    Bb
Or get between the sheets?
         Dm
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
          Dm
Would you like something to eat?
          Eb
Would you like to learn to fly?  Would you?
          Dm
Would you like to see me try?

D       G   C   
&lt;SOLO&gt;
Eb   Bb   Eb   Bb   Dm        Eb   Bb   Eb   Bb   Dm  Am7 Dm7 C
          Eb               Bb
Would you like to call the cops?
       Eb                Bb
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Gm(9)
Why are you running away?
