    <pre><code>La la la-la-la, La la la-la-la

CHORUS x2 with MAIN FILL
VERSE 1 x2 bass only - &lt;FILL 1&gt;

&lt;VERSE 1 - x4 bass, x4 with guitar&gt;
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over - I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert  &lt;FILL 2&gt;
Now I know I&#39;m being used
That&#39;s okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she&#39;s playing with me
That&#39;s okay cause I&#39;ve got no self-esteem

CHORUS
Oh yeah, yeah yeah-yeah       Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah-yeah       Oh yeah, yeah

&lt;VERSE 1 - x2 bass, x2 guitar &amp; bass&gt;
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection&#39;s got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

CHORUS

&lt;VERSE 2 ending with MAIN FILL&gt;
When she&#39;s saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she&#39;s saying that I&#39;m like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it&#39;s better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right?

&lt;VERSE 1 - x2 bass&gt; FILL 1

&lt;VERSE 1 - x4 bass, x4 with guitar&gt;
Now I&#39;ll relate this little bit
That happens more than I&#39;d like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score  &lt;FILL 2&gt;
Now I know I should say no
But that&#39;s kind of hard when she&#39;s ready to go
I may be dumb - But I&#39;m not a dweeb
I&#39;m just a sucker with no self-esteem

CHORUS

REPEAT VERSE 2
