    <pre><code>D
Nibblin&#39; on some sponge cake
D
Watching the sun bake
D                                  A
All of those tourists covered with oil
A
Strumming my six-string
A
On my front porch swing
A7                                       D    D7
Smell those shrimp, they&#39;re beginnin&#39; to boil


CHORUS:
G         A                  D            D7  
  Wastin&#39; away again in Margaritaville
G                 A               D     D7
  Searching for my lost shaker of salt
G              A                   D  A     G
  Some people claim that there&#39;s a woman to blame
        A7                  D
  But I know  it&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault


I don&#39;t know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin&#39; to show but this brand new tattoo
But it&#39;s a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven&#39;t a clue

Wastin&#39; away again in Margaritaville
Searchin&#39; for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there&#39;s a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop-top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there&#39;s booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

Wastin&#39; away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claimt hat ther&#39;s a woman to blame
But I know it&#39;s my own damned fault

Yes, and some people claim that ther&#39;s a woman to balme
And I know, it&#39;s my own damned fault
