    <pre><code>INTRO

Although ya try to discredit
Ya still never edit
The needle, I&#39;ll thread it
Radically poetic
Standin&#39; with the fury that they had in &#39;66
And like E-Double I&#39;m mad
Still knee-deep in the system&#39;s shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I&#39;ll give ya a dose
But it&#39;ll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air, in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease
When their heads are flown
&#39;Cause all these punks
Got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, the judges, the feds
Networks at work, keepin&#39; people calm
You know they went after King
When he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

INTRO

Wit&#39; poetry, my mind I flex
Flip like Wilson, vocals never lackin&#39; dat finesse
Whadda I got to, whadda I got to do to wake ya up
To shake ya up, to break the structure up
&#39;Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I&#39;m like takin&#39; photos
Mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove
Then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the stutter step
Then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yea, the several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream
And put it to an end
Ya better beware
Of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin&#39; people calm
Ya know they murdered X
And tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
What was the price on his head?
