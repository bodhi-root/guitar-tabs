  Please allow me to introduce myself, I&#39;m a man of wealth and taste
I&#39;ve been around for long, long years I&#39;ve stolen many a man&#39;s soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ had His moments of doubt and pain
I made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate
B                   B                    E
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
A                                D               E
  but what&#39;s puzzling you, is the nature of my game


I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was time for a change
I killed the Tzar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a gen&#39;ral&#39;s rank, when the blitzkrieg raged
                                                and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what&#39;s puzzling you, is the nature of my game


I watched with glee while your kings and queens, fought for
                              ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out &quot;Who killed the Kennedys?&quot;, when after all it was you and me
So let me please introduce myself, I am a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadours, who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what&#39;s puzzling you, is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what&#39;s confusing you, is just the nature of my game


Just as every cop is criminal, and all the sinners, Saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer, &#39;cause I&#39;m in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse, or I&#39;ll lay your soul to waste
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what&#39;s puzzling you, is the nature of my game
