  Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for long, long years I've stolen many a man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ had His moments of doubt and pain
I made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate
B                   B                    E
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
A                                D               E
  but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game


I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was time for a change
I killed the Tzar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a gen'ral's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged
                                                and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game


I watched with glee while your kings and queens, fought for
                              ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out &quot;Who killed the Kennedys?&quot;, when after all it was you and me
So let me please introduce myself, I am a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadours, who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what's confusing you, is just the nature of my game


Just as every cop is criminal, and all the sinners, Saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer, 'cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse, or I'll lay your soul to waste
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game
