Fm            C                 
   I&#39;ve got a little black book with my poems in
      E
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
      F                                       C
When I&#39;m a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
F              C
   I&#39;ve got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
         E                E7
Got those swollen hand blues
      F                                    C
Got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from
      C             C7    
I got electric light and I got second sight
        F   Fm              C    E7  Am  D7   
Got amazing powers of observation
G                    E7
   And that is how I know
Am                       C6                        C  D
   When I try to get thru on the telephone to you
Fm6                   C   F  C
There&#39;ll be nobody home.



               C
I&#39;ve got the obligatory Hendrix perm
        E
And the inevitable pinhole burns
F                                       C
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt
         C
I&#39;ve got nicotine stains on my fingers
          E                  E7
I&#39;ve got a silver spoon on a chain
      F                                C
Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
        C                  C7
I&#39;ve got wide staring eyes, And I&#39;ve got a strong urge to fly
    F        Fm         C    E7  Am  D7      (G   E7)
But I&#39;ve got nowhere to fly to (fly to fly to fly to fly to)
Am                                     C6    C  D
   Ooooh babe, why not pick up the phone?
Fm6                     C   F  C
There&#39;s still nobody home.

       C
I got a pair of Gohill boots,
E           (E7)
   And I got fading roots...
