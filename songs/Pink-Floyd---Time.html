    <pre><code>N.C.(E) (F#m) (E) (F#m) (E) (F#m) (E) (F#m) (A) (E) (F#m)


F#m                                         A     Asus4 A
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
E                                                F#m
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
F#m                                         A
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
E                                                    F#m
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.


Dmaj7                          Amaj7
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
Dmaj7                              Amaj7
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
Dmaj7                     C#m7
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
Bm7                          E                            F5
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.


[Guitar solo]
F#m A E F#m A F#m A E F#m A E F#m
Dmaj7 Amaj7 Dmaj7 Amaj7 Dmaj7 C#m7 Bm7 E


           F#m                                                A
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it&#39;s sinking
E                                        F#m
Racing around to come up behind you again.
                                                    A     A7 A7sus4 A7
The sun is the same in a relative way but you&#39;re older,
E                                            F#m
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.


Dmaj7                         Amaj7
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Dmaj7                               Amaj7
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Dmaj7                      C#m
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way
    Bm
The time is gone, the song is over,
Bm7                   F/B
Thought I&#39;d something more to say.
