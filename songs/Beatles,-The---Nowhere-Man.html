    <pre><code>C           G
He&#39;s a real nowhere man
F              C
Sitting in his nowhere land
F              Fm                F   C    Bb  F  C
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

C              G
Doesn&#39;t have a point of view
F                    G
Knows not where he&#39;s going to
F          Fm               F   C
Isn&#39;t he a bit like you and me?


CHORUS:
         Em         F
Nowhere man, please listen
          Em               F
You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing
        Em       F                    G7
Nowhere man, the world is at your command


He&#39;s as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

Doesn&#39;t have a point of view
Knows not where he&#39;s going to,
Isn&#39;t he a bit like you and me?

&lt;CHORUS&gt;
Nowhere man, don&#39;t worry,
Take your time, don&#39;t hurry,
Leave it all &#39;till somebody else lends you a hand

He&#39;s a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
F              Fm                F   C
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
F              Fm                C
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody...
