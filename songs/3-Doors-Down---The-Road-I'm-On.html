    <pre><code>PART 1

&lt;PART 1&gt;
She said life's a lot to think about sometimes
When you're living in between the lines
And all of the stars are sparkling, shine everyday
He said life's so hard to move in sometimes
When it feels like I'm in the line
And no one even cares to ask me why I feel this way
&lt;PART 2&gt;
And I know you feel helpless now, and I know you feel, hold on
That's the same road, the same road that I'm on, yeah

&lt;PART 1&gt;
He said life's a lot to think about sometimes
When you keep it on between the lines
And everything I want and I want to find one of these days
&lt;PART 2&gt;
But what you thought was real in life
Oh, it somehow steer you wrong
And now you just keep trying and trying to find out where you belong
And I know you feel helpless now, and I know you feel, hold on
That's the same road, the same road that I'm on

SOLO (played over part 2)

&lt;PART 1&gt;
What you thought was real in life, somehow steer you wrong
And now you just keep trying and trying to find where you belong
&lt;PART 2&gt;
I know you feel helpless now, I know you feel, hold on
That's the same, the same road that I'm on
