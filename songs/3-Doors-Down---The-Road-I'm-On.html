    <pre><code>PART 1

&lt;PART 1&gt;
She said life&#39;s a lot to think about sometimes
When you&#39;re living in between the lines
And all of the stars are sparkling, shine everyday
He said life&#39;s so hard to move in sometimes
When it feels like I&#39;m in the line
And no one even cares to ask me why I feel this way
&lt;PART 2&gt;
And I know you feel helpless now, and I know you feel, hold on
That&#39;s the same road, the same road that I&#39;m on, yeah

&lt;PART 1&gt;
He said life&#39;s a lot to think about sometimes
When you keep it on between the lines
And everything I want and I want to find one of these days
&lt;PART 2&gt;
But what you thought was real in life
Oh, it somehow steer you wrong
And now you just keep trying and trying to find out where you belong
And I know you feel helpless now, and I know you feel, hold on
That&#39;s the same road, the same road that I&#39;m on

And now you just keep trying and trying to find where you belong
&lt;PART 2&gt;
I know you feel helpless now, I know you feel, hold on
That&#39;s the same, the same road that I&#39;m on
