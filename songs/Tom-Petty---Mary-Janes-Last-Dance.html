<pre><code>[Intro]
Am    G    Dsus2    Am   (x4)

[Verse]
Am                G
She grew up in an Indiana town
      Dsus2                     Am
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
       Am                    G
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
          Dsus2                    Am
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

Am    G    Dsus2    Am   (x2) w/harmonica

[Verse 2]
Am                                 G
Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen
            Dsus2                             Am
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
Am                                G
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
            Dsus2                               Am
She said, &quot;I dig you baby but I got to keep movin'&quot;

Am      G    Dsus2    Am
...on, keep movin' on
Am      G    Dsus2    Am

[Chorus]
Em7
Last dance with Mary Jane
Em7                         A
One more time to kill the pain
Em7
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Em7                   A      G
Tired of this town again

Am    G    Dsus2    Am   (x2) w/harmonica

[Verse 3]
Am                    G
Well I don't know, but I've been told
         Dsus2                     Am
You never slow down, you never grow old
Am                  G
I'm tired of screwing up, I'm tired of going down
Dsus2                        Am
Tired of myself, tired of this town
Am                   G
Oh my my, oh hell yes
         Dsus2              Am
Honey put on that party dress
Am                        G
Buy me a drink, sing me a song,
Dsus2                           Am
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

[Chorus]
Em7
Last dance with Mary Jane
Em7                         A
One more time to kill the pain
Em7
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Em7                  A      G
Tired of this town again

[Solo]
Am    G    Dsus2    Am   (x4)

[Verse 4]
Am                   G
There's pigeons down on Market Square
         Dsus2                     Am
She's standin' in her underwear
Am                  G
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Dsus2                               Am
Nightfall will be comin' soon
Am                   G
Oh my my, oh hell yes
      Dsus2              Am
You got to put on that party dress
Am                        G
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
Dsus2                            Am
I hit my last number and walked to the road

[Chorus]
Em7
Last dance with Mary Jane
Em7                         A
One more time to kill the pain
Em7
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Em7                  A      G
Tired of this town again

Am    G    Dsus2   Am
(Play over and over till out, with solo guitar and harmonica)
