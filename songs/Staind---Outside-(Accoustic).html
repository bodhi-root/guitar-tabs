[Intro]
Eb5 Db5 Gb5 Ab5 (2x)

[Verse 1]
    Eb5       Db5            Gb5     Ab5
And you, can bring me to my knees, again.
         Eb5       Db5               Gb5       Ab5
All this time, that I could beg you please, in vain.
        Eb5        Db5         Gb5       Ab5
All the times, that I felt insecure, for you.
       Eb5     Db5            Gb5   Ab5\
And I leave my burdens at the door.

[Chorus]
               Eb                   Gb
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in.
            Db                       Ab
I can see through you, see your true colors.
                     Eb                     Gb
'Cause inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me.
             Db                    Ab
I can see through you, see to the real you.

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
        Eb5           Db5                  Gb5           Ab5
All the times, that I felt like this won't end. It's for you.
      Eb5        Db5            Gb5             Ab5
And I taste, what I could never have. It's from you.
        Eb5               Db5         Gb5               Ab5
All the times! That I've cried! My intentions. Full of pride!
      Eb5         Db5          Gb5  Ab5\
But I waste, more time than anyone.

[Chorus]
               Eb                   Gb
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in.
            Db                       Ab
I can see through you, see your true colors.
                     Eb                     Gb
'Cause inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me.
             Db                    Ab
I can see through you, see to the real you.

[Verse 3]
        Eb5               Db5            Gb5                Ab5
All the times! That I've cried! All this wasted! It's all inside!
      Eb5            Db5              Gb5              Ab5
And I feel! All this pain! Stuffed it down! It's back again!
      Eb5          Db5       Gb5           Ab5
And I lie! Here in bed! All alone. I can't mend.
      Eb5     Db5              Gb5  Ab5\
But I feel, tomorrow will be O.K.

[Chorus]
               Eb                   Gb
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in.
            Db                       Ab
I can see through you, see your true colors.
                     Eb                     Gb
'Cause inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me.
             Db                    Ab\
I can see through you, see to the real you.
