    <pre><code>Must be your skin that I'm sinking in
Must be for real cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind it's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why
Everything's gone white and everything's grey
Now you're here now you're away
I don't want this remember that
I'll never forget where you're at

Don't let the days go by
Glycerine, Glycerine

I'm never alone I'm alone all the time
Are you at one or do you lie
We live in a wheel where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields
If I treated you bad you bruised my face
Couldn't love you more you got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me
Glycerine, Glycerine
Don't let the days go by
Glycerine
Don't let the days go by

Glycerine! Glycerine!    (played with MAIN figure)
Glycerine! Glycerine!

I needed you more when we wanted us less
I could not kiss just regress
It might just be me clear simple and plain
That's just fine that's just one of my names

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you, you, you
Glycerine, Glycerine, Glycerine
