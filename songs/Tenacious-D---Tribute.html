<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<pre><code>[Intro]

Am
This is the greatest and best song in the world...   Tribute.


[Verse 1]

Am
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
Am
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
Am
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
Am
In the middle of the road.
Am
And he said:


(strum palm muted)

A5
&quot;Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls.&quot;


(back to normal picking)

Am
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
Am
And we each said...   &quot;Okay&quot;

Am                                 G
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
F
Just so happened to be,
Am                   G             F
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.


[Chorus 1]

D                          F
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
        C                     G
One and one make two, two and one make three,
        F
It was destiny.
D                           F
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
         C                      G
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
         F
And the grass don't grow...


[Verse 2]

Am
Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Am
Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
Am
And the beast was done.
Am
He asked us: &quot;Be you angels?&quot;
Am
And we said, &quot;Nay. We are but men!&quot; ROCK!


[Interlude]

D     F     C       G
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
F
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!


[Chorus 2]

Am               G                   Am
This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
Am                 G        Am
No, this is just a tribute.
Am                    G                    Am
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World.
Am            G        Am
No, this is a tribute, oh.

Am G               D           F
   To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
Am G                   D           F
   It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
Am         G
It was the best muthafuckin' song
D                        F
The greatest song in the world.


[Solo]

N.C.

N.C.
Goo guh fli-goo gee goo, guh fli-goo ga goo buh dee
N.C.
Ooh guh goo bee, ooh guh guh bee guh guh bee
N.C.
Fli-goo gee goo, a-fli-guh woo wa mama Lucifer!

Am   G   D   F
Am   G   D   F


[Interlude]

Am               G
And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
D                        F
The song we sang on that fateful night,
Am                       G                  D      F
It didn't actually sound anything like this song.


[Verse 3]

               Am           G           D      F
This is just a tribute! You gotta' believe me!
                    Am      G                 D      F
And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
          Am        G
Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',
D                    F
So surprised to find you can't stop it.
Am                   G
Oh hallelujah, I'm found
 D                   F
Rich motherfucker, ka-chug!


[Outro]

E      F       E         F
          All right!
E      F       E         F
          All right!                   

E      F       F         F
