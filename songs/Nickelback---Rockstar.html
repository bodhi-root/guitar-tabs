    <pre><code>                 G
I&#39;m through with standing in line to clubs we&#39;ll never get in
              C
It&#39;s like the bottom of the ninth and I&#39;m never gonna win
    F                                                  G
This life hasn&#39;t turned out quite the way I want it to be  

       [Spoken: Tell me what you want&#39;]

         G
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
      C
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
      F                                     G
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

       [Spoken: Tell me what you need&#39;]

               G
I&#39;ll need a - a credit card that&#39;s got no limit
      C
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
      F                                                 G
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

       [Spoken: Been there, done that&#39;]

         G
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
       C
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
    F                                             G
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

       [Spoken: so how you gonna do it?]

[Prechorus]
          A#
I&#39;m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
         C
I&#39;d even cut my hair and change my name

[CHORUS (power chords sound good, esp. on D#)]
          G
&#39;Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
            A#
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
    C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      D#                        F
We&#39;ll all stay skinny &#39;cause we just won&#39;t eat
         G
And we&#39;ll hang out in the coolest bars
       A#
In the VIP with the movie stars
      C
Every good gold digger&#39;s gonna wind up there
      D#                     F
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
A#   C                    G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
A#   C                    G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar

VERSE 2
           G
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
     C
Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes
       F                                           G
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

       [Spoken: I&#39;ll have the quesadilla&#39;]

          G
I&#39;m gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
      C
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
      F                                                 G
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

       [Spoken: so how you gonna do it?]

REPEAT PRECHORUS
REPEAT CHORUS (minus &#39;Hey, hey&#39;&#39;), BUT ADD:

         G
And we&#39;ll hide out in the private rooms
         A#
With the latest dictionary and today&#39;s who&#39;s who
        C
They&#39;ll get you anything with that evil smile
     D#                       F
Everybody&#39;s got a drug dealer on speed dial

A#   C                    G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar

          D#
I&#39;m gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
      A#
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
         D#
I&#39;ll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
C                                  
Lip sync em every night so I don&#39;t get &#39;em wrong

REPEAT PRECHORUS
