    <pre><code>Bm                       A
  Hello, Is there any body in there?
                    G  D/F#  Em           Bm
Just nod if you can hear me,     is there anyone at home?
Bm                        A
Come on, now, I hear your feeling  down,
      G         D/F#   Em            Bm
Well, I can ease  your  pain, get you on your feet again.
Bm                     A         
Relax, I need some information, first,
G             D/F# Em           Bm
  Just the basic facts, Can you show me where it hurts?


D                        A
There is no pain you are receding,
D                      A        G/B
A distant ships smoke, on the horizon,
C                       G
You are only coming through in waves,
C                                 G
Your lips move, but I can&#39;t hear what your saying,


     D                 A
When I was a child, I had a fever,
  D                         A       G/B
My hands felt just like, two balloons,
C                       G
Now I&#39;ve got that feeling once again, I can&#39;t explain
              C                             G
You would not understand, this is not how I am,
A        G/B  C           G            D
I                        have become, comfortably numb.


SOLO 1


Bm              A
O.K., just a little pin prick,
G        D/F#  Em                         Bm  
There&#39;ll be no more (scream), but you may feel a little sick
        Bm                           A
Can you stand up?  I do believe it&#39;s working, good.
                 G     D/F#           Em    Bm
That&#39;ll keep you going throughout the show, c&#39;mon, it&#39;s time to go



D                 A
There is no pain you are receding,
D                A       G/B
A distant ships smoke on the horizon,
C                 G
You are only coming through in waves,
    C                          G
Your lips move, but I can&#39;t hear what your saying,



    D                    A
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse,
D                  A     G/B
Out of the corner of my eye,
C                       G
I turned to look, but it was gone, I can not put my finger
C                                           G
On it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone,
A        G/B  C       G               D
and I              have become comfortably numb.
