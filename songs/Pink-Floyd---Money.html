    <pre><code>Bm7
Money, get away.
Get a good job with more pay and you&#39;re okay.
Money, it&#39;s a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.

F#m7
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Em                          Bm7
Think I&#39;ll buy me a football team.

Bm7
Money, get back.
I&#39;m all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it&#39;s a hit.
Don&#39;t give me that do goody good bullshit.

           F#m7                                 Em
I&#39;m in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
                         Bm7
And I think I need a Lear jet.

Bm7
Money, it&#39;s a crime.
Share it fairly but don&#39;t take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.

F#m7                                   Em                             Bm
But if you ask for a raise it&#39;s no surprise that they&#39;re giving none away.
